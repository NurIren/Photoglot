# Photoglot

PhotoGlot is a language learning tool. The user aims the camera at an object, and the name of that object is displayed in the language of choice. Our app aims to aid in language learning. Instead of using an intermediary language to determine what an object is in a foreign language, our app allows for direct association of an object with a word in that language.

## Photoglot as a web app

Photoglot was initially built at SheInnovates 2018 as a web app. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/ChloeCiora/sheInnovates18) 

## Photoglot as an iOS app

Photoglot was later turned into an iOS app. It uses Apple Vision Resnet50 and Microsoft Azure text translator API. To run the app, you will need an API key. This code was tested using an iphone 7, so settings may change with different models.


## Awards

The iOS app version of Photoglot has won first Place in the Pitt Mobile App Challenge 2018 Code-it category. The web app version of Photoglot won third at SheInnovates 2018.
